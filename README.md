C++ Resource Management (RAII)

This repository demonstrates deterministic resource lifetime control in C++.

Examples:
- temporary_file_raii – automatic cleanup of file resource
- move_ownership – transfer of ownership via move semantics
- scope_lifetime – destruction on scope exit

The goal is to show how C++ manages resources without garbage collection.
